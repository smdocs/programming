##### Introduction
JBender makes it easy to build load testers for services using protocols like HTTP and Thrift (and many others). JBender provides 
a library of flexible, easy-to-use primitives that can be combined (with plain Java code) to build high performance load testers 
customized to any use case, and that can evolve with your service over time.

##### Goals
